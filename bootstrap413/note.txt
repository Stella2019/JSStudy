failed to run: bundle install

because:

"An error occurred while installing nokogiri (1.8.4), and Bundler cannot
 continue.
 Make sure that `gem install nokogiri -v '1.8.4' --source
 'https://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before bundling."

go to: http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html
found the following:

run: sudo apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev

There's a libxml2 package for that. You can install it with:

sudo apt-get install libxml2
If you want to compile software from source based on libxml2 you need the development files:

sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev

gem install nokogiri -v '1.8.4' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'
